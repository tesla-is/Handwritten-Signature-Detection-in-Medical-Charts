# Signature Detection on PDFs (YOLOv8)

Detect and localize handwritten/ink signatures in PDF documents using a YOLOv8 model.  
This project converts each PDF page to an image, enhances contrast, runs a trained signature detector, saves annotated pages for all detections, and generates **structured analytics** at both the PDF level and the page level.

> **Who is this for?** Data/ML engineers, RPA and operations teams, audit/compliance analysts, and anyone needing automated signature presence checks at scale.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **End‑to‑end pipeline**: PDF → high‑DPI images → contrast enhancement (CLAHE) → YOLOv8 inference → annotation → analytics CSVs  
- **Batch & multithreaded**: Processes many PDFs and pages efficiently  
- **Detailed analytics**: Confidence, bounding boxes, area/density metrics, position categories, page counts with signatures  
- **Portable**: Works in plain Python; includes display helpers for notebook/Databricks environments  
- **Secure by design**: Uses environment variables for secrets (Hugging Face token)

## 🧠 What it does (elaborate description)

Signature verification is a frequent requirement in document workflows (intake, claims, contracting, audits). This project automates the **detection** (not semantic verification) of signature regions on PDF pages. It:

1. **Loads PDFs** from an input directory and **renders each page** into a high‑resolution RGB image using **PyMuPDF** (DPI configurable).
2. Applies **CLAHE** (contrast‑limited adaptive histogram equalization) to gently enhance faint pen strokes so thin ink lines are more detectable against noisy backgrounds.
3. Runs a **YOLOv8** model specialized for signature detection. Thresholds for confidence (`conf`) and NMS IOU (`iou`) are configurable, and it supports GPU or CPU execution.
4. **Annotates** only the pages that contain at least one detection and writes them as `PNG` images (red bounding boxes without labels).
5. Computes **page‑level metrics** such as top detection confidence, bounding box coordinates/area/aspect ratio, a **signature density** ratio (total detected area over page area), a **position category** (center/quadrants/edges), and the number of signatures per page.
6. Aggregates a **PDF‑level summary** listing the total pages, the number of pages with signatures, and the 1‑based page indices where signatures were detected.
7. Exports two CSVs to your output folder:
   - `pdf_level_summary.csv`
   - `pdf_page_level_analytics.csv`

The pipeline is optimized for **practical throughput** with multithreading per page. For very small or faint signatures, increasing DPI (e.g., 400–600) and maintaining a larger inference image size (e.g., 1280) can boost recall.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1) Python environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Linux/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) GPU (optional)
If you have CUDA, install a CUDA‑enabled PyTorch build per your environment. Ultralytics/YOLOv8 will leverage it automatically when `DEVICE="0"` (or another CUDA device index).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Use **environment variables** (recommended) so paths and secrets are never hard‑coded:

```bash
export INPUT_PDF_DIR="/path/to/pdfs"             # required
export OUTPUT_ROOT="./output"                    # defaults to ./output if not set
export HF_TOKEN="***your_hf_access_token***"     # required (gated model access)
export DEVICE="0"                                # "cpu" or CUDA index like "0"
export DPI="600"                                 # 300–600 recommended
export CONF_THRESHOLD="0.25"
export IOU_THRESHOLD="0.5"
export MAX_WORKERS="8"                           # 4–16 depending on CPU cores/IO
```

> **Do not commit tokens**. Use your org’s secret store for production/Databricks.

## 🧩 How it works (pipeline & internals)

1. **PDF rendering**  
   Uses **PyMuPDF** to rasterize each page:
   - `DPI` controls the zoom factor (`zoom = DPI / 72`). Higher DPI yields more pixels and helps detect small signatures, with a trade‑off in memory and time.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Applies **CLAHE** on the L channel in LAB space to gently boost local contrast (useful for faint ink strokes), then converts back to BGR.

3. **YOLOv8 inference**  
   - Loads a **YOLOv8s** signature detector from a **gated Hugging Face** repo:
     ```
     repo_id: tech4humans/yolov8s-signature-detector
     filename: yolov8s.pt
     ```
   - You must supply `HF_TOKEN` (via env/secret).  
   - Runs prediction with configurable `conf`, `iou`, and `device`.

4. **Annotation**  
   - Only pages with detections are saved to disk.
   - Red bounding boxes (no labels) are drawn using the **Supervision** library.

5. **Analytics**  
   - Aggregates page‑level and PDF‑level metrics (see Output Details).

6. **Parallelization**  
   - Each page is processed in a thread (`ThreadPoolExecutor`).
   - Tune `MAX_WORKERS` per your CPU, IO, and memory profile.

---

## ✅ Practical settings & tips

- **Recall on tiny signatures**:  
  Increase `DPI` to 400–600 and keep YOLO input size ≥1280 (already set).
- **Performance**:  
  Start with `MAX_WORKERS=4–8`. Increasing beyond core count yields diminishing returns due to I/O and GIL on some steps.
- **Memory constraints**:  
  Rendering at high DPI for long PDFs can be memory‑intensive. If you hit OOM:
  - Reduce `DPI` (e.g., 300–450)
  - Process a limited set of pages at a time (future: streaming refactor)
- **GPU vs CPU**:  
  Use `DEVICE="0"` for GPU 0; use `"cpu"` when a GPU isn’t available.

export CONF_THRESHOLD="0.25"
export IOU_THRESHOLD="0.5"
export DEVICE="0"
export MAX_WORKERS="8"

python signature_detection.py

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- **Secrets**: Never commit tokens or API keys. Use environment variables or your organization’s secret management (e.g., Vault, Databricks Secrets).
- **PHI/PII**: If PDFs may contain PHI/PII, follow your org’s data handling, access, and retention policies. Annotated page images can capture sensitive content; store outputs securely and delete when no longer needed.
- **Model licensing**: The model is fetched from a **gated** Hugging Face repository. Ensure each user has access and accepts the upstream license/usage terms. This repo **does not** redistribute model weights.

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

- **`HF_TOKEN not set` / cannot download weights**  
  Ensure the token is exported and has access to the gated repo.
- **Zero detections**  
  - Try `DPI=600`, lower `CONF_THRESHOLD` to `0.2`, ensure the page isn’t too low‑resolution.
- **OOM when rasterizing**  
  - Lower `DPI`, or process fewer pages at once (future: streaming approach).
- **Slow performance**  
  - Use a GPU (`DEVICE="0"`), try `MAX_WORKERS=8–16`, and run from fast storage (local SSD).

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

- CLI wrapper via `argparse` (replace env‑only configuration)
- Streamed page processing to reduce peak memory
- Optional **redaction** exports (blur or mask signature regions)
- Unit tests for metrics, position classification, and IO
- Dockerfile for reproducible runs and CI
- Configurable visual styles (labels, colors, thickness)
- Structured logs and progress reporting

---

## 🧱 Known limitations

- **Detection ≠ authentication**: This model detects signature‑like regions; it does not verify authenticity or match identities.
- **Model generalization**: Performance depends on document quality (scan DPI, noise, skew) and signature appearance (ink color, thickness).
